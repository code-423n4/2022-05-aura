[Proposal] Allowlist Aura Finance in Balancer VotingEscrow
Summary This proposal is to whitelist Aura Finance in Balancer’s VotingEscrow contract allowing Aura Finance to lock BAL (in the form of 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT), participate in Balancer governance, and provide additional rewards to Balancer ecosystem participants without immediate disposal of BAL rewards.   Abstract Aura Finance is a protocol built ...

aura is like convex for balancer right?


[05/11/2022 3:44 PM] phijfry#7179
Correct, aura is a fork of the original Convex code. There are a few differences, we have tried our best to note them in the context README.


[05/11/2022 4:07 PM] fufanuu
thanks


[05/11/2022 5:29 PM] 0x4non
Are there any tests? i couldnt find them on the main repo


[05/11/2022 5:47 PM] 0xmaha
The test output is listed there (test-output.txt && test-fork-output.txt) but not the actual tests


[05/11/2022 5:48 PM] 0xmaha
The whole test suite and deployment tasks revolve around 1 shared deploy script. We didn't want to share that because of the risk of competitors forking


[05/11/2022 6:21 PM] fufanuu
=/


[05/11/2022 6:22 PM] fufanuu
just came to ask about test cases as well because you can save a ton of gas by doing some things and fixing some things.. I made some changes to your code base and wanted to run tests and make sure it still works


[05/11/2022 6:23 PM] fufanuu
insuring a good security audit imo is more important than worrying about someone forking your code, just my .02

Same here, they don't need test to fork you and I think we could do a better job with test

The link to see differences between convex and aura contracts is wrong

Look at this there are two requires


[05/11/2022 7:13 PM] pedroais
The differences show a third require was added but I can't see it in the actual code

Ahh yes, we've just realised we missed a commit that was this line when pushing code to the C4 repo. I blame git submodules... but yeee my mistake. We've just pushed a commit to rectify this and bring it up to date.  Thanks for pointing this out! 🙂

Looks like this is only an issue on Windows. 😦


[05/18/2022 8:59 AM] 0xmaha
Did you run `yarn && yarn compile` first?


[05/18/2022 9:06 AM] 100proof
I spoke to @samruna earlier. Yes he did run those two things first. I think there's something strange about his set up on Windows. It works fine on my Mac OS X set up.


[05/18/2022 2:38 PM] samruna
Yes all correct steps were taken, It was path problem on windows, not used to running on windows..but thanks for jumping in..

Glad you got it sorted out @samruna


[05/20/2022 2:49 PM] 0xmaha
Hey Wardens. In my eagerness to address some of the reports that you have made, I accidently misunderstood the rules of the bounty and pushed the fixes (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/pull/5) directly to the repo. To make up for leaking c4 alpha, we've discussed it with the C4 team and we're going to make that code eligible for review as well. So, the changes to the `BaseRewardPool4626.sol` and `BaseRewardPool.sol` are now open for findings and will be included in the payout 😄

In the interest of fairness, the findings addressed by the pull request will be eligible only up to the timestamp of the PR. Thanks for understanding and rolling with us on this one, folks. ❤️

[05/20/2022 2:56 PM] fufanuu
So if the PR is something we submitted as a finding what's the result I guess? i'm a bit confused.. Just to understand clearly, if I had already submitted those findings before the PR, it will be included in payouts/judging?


[05/20/2022 3:43 PM] pedroais
So if I had found some of those bugs but was waiting until the end to submit I can no longer submit them ?

Correct 😦 I'm very sorry. This is an unusual circumstance and definitely something that we try to avoid.


[05/20/2022 6:28 PM] sockdrawermoney
I would say _do_ submit them TODAY and note that you had found them prior. We'll try to come up with a way to handle for folks who get them in today. 

I'm going to ask folks to honor your fellow competitors and only submit those bugs today if you legitimately found them prior to seeing the PR.

[05/21/2022 12:05 PM] kamensec
can we get a clear list of what was actually fixed? would save having to go through a diff and we can focus instead on the outstanding code


[05/21/2022 12:05 PM] kamensec
or like what the actual issues were that were submitted that lead to the changes


[05/21/2022 1:58 PM] dmitriia
It's all in PR 5 above


[05/21/2022 6:56 PM] sockdrawermoney
no, this is more of a one-off circumstance


[05/21/2022 6:58 PM] sockdrawermoney
@0xMaha now that we've passed the 'today' I mentioned above, if you want to share the details of the specific findings addressed by the PR here or in the comments on the PR , that would be useful for folks who are reviewing the changes.
